Abstract = {Neural networks are increasingly being used in real-world business applications and, in some cases, such as fraud detection, they have already become the method of choice. Their use for risk assessment is also growing and they have been employed to visualise complex databases for marketing segmentation. This boom in applications covers a wide range of business interests — from finance management, through forecasting, to production. The combination of statistical, neural and fuzzy methods now enables direct quantitative studies to be carried out without the need for rocket-science expertise.This book reviews the state-of-the-art in current applications of neural-network methods in three important areas of business analysis. It includes a tutorial chapter to introduce new users to the potential and pitfalls of this new technology.},

Abstract = {Physicians in everyday clinical practice are under pressure to innovate faster than ever because of the rapid, exponential growth in healthcare data. "Big data" refers to extremely large data sets that cannot be analyzed or interpreted using traditional data processing methods. In fact, big data itself is meaningless, but processing it offers the promise of unlocking novel insights and accelerating breakthroughs in medicine-which in turn has the potential to transform current clinical practice. Physicians can analyze big data, but at present it requires a large amount of time and sophisticated analytic tools such as supercomputers. However, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in the era of big data could assist physicians in shortening processing times and improving the quality of patient care in clinical practice. This editorial provides a glimpse at the potential uses of AI technology in clinical practice and considers the possibility of AI replacing physicians, perhaps altoget},

It will encourage you to embrace the arrival of AI (particularly the Augmented variety) as a positive force for the enablement of knowledge workers, and will help you to decide what tasks currently being undertaken by your knowledge workers, can be offloaded to the machine. The book will guide you to look at your most value-add activities – those that require the application of expertise, such as strategic sales, marketing strategy, and customer engagement – and consider how these activities would be better with augmented intelligence. Solving this problem will deliver rapid competitive advantage.},

Abstract = {This study presents new evidence on firms' views about the impact of artificial intelligence ( AI) and robotics on their business and employment, using data from an original survey of more than 3,000 Japanese firms. The focus of this study is on technology-skill complementarity. Firms with highly educated employees tend to expect positive impacts of AI-related technologies on their business, and vice versa. Larger firms and firms that engage in global markets tend to have positive views about the impacts of AI-related technologies. ( JEL O33, J23, J24, M15) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
